	//
	// - sendInitialEvent and RV>0 - provides the initial events and when we reach the desired RV,
	//   the synthetic bookmark event. Note that the desired RV must be >= the current revision the server knows about.
	//   If the desired RV is older than the current revision the server is aware of, the TooLargeResourceVersionError is returned.
	//   Essentially this provides NotOlderThan semantics.
	// - sendInitialEvent and RV=0 - provides the initial events and the synthetic bookmark with the current RV.
	// - sendInitialEvent and RV="" - matches data at the most recent ResourceVersion.
	//   The returned data is consistent, that is, served from etcd via a quorum read.
	//   It provides the initial events, any other updates and the synthetic bookmark
	//   event with the most recent ResourceVersion.
